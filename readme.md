# Find75

App which shows current position of Szczecin's buses.

It bases on data from [ZDITM](http://www.zditm.szczecin.pl/) and shows position of buses which have GPS.
Some older buses haven't buildin GPS, so app won't show their positions.

## TODO
- install angular
- get data from [ZDITM](http://www.zditm.szczecin.pl/) and parse it
- gui with select which allow to show postion of current line or station
- add google-map or open street map
- show selected buses on map
- show buses based on bus station
